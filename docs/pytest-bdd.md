# Pytest BDD Notes

## What is Pytest-BDD

Pytest-BDD is a plugin for pytest that lets users write tests using the Gherkin syntax. Gherkin is a language 
that is used to describe the behavior of software in a human-readable format. Pytest-BDD allows users to write 
tests in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.
